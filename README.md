# dotfiles
This contains all of the tools I need for day-to-day dev work.

## setup (mac)
1. Install [alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)<br>
   NOTE: Mac will complain about this Application if you double-click it. Instead, right-click, "open", and hit open.
2. Install [brew](https://brew.sh/)
3. `cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/maxcopeland/dotfiles.git`
4. `brew bundle install`
